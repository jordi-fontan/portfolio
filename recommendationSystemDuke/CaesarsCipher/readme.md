# Sylabus

Cryptography: Keeping Information Secret

1. In this module, you will learn about the basics of cryptography, the science of keeping information private and secure.
    - You will learn about simpler cryptographic systems, which were used from the Roman Empire through the early 1900s. 
    - You will learn how to implement these ciphers, as well as how to break them. 
    - To solve these problems, you will work more with processing Strings, but also learn about arrays—a way to store an indexable sequence of elements. 
    - 
2. You will be able to:

  - (1) combine Strings using concatenation; 
  - (2) build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder; 
  - (3) use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data;
  - (4) refactor your programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles; 
  - (5) and practice effective algorithm design.
